// The following mixins include base theme styles that are only needed once per application. These
// theme styles do not depend on the color, typography, or density settings in your theme. However,
// these styles may differ depending on the theme's design system. Currently all themes use the
// Material 2 design system, but in the future it may be possible to create theme based on other
// design systems, such as Material 3.
//
// Please note: you do not need to include the 'base' mixins, if you include the corresponding
// 'theme' mixin elsewhere in your Sass. The full 'theme' mixins already include the base styles.
//
// To learn more about "base" theme styles visit our theming guide:
// https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#theming-dimensions
//
// TODO(v17): Please move these @include statements to the preferred place in your Sass, and pass
// your theme to them. This will ensure the correct values for your app are included.
